- ‚úÖ **Performance Analytics** - Personal records, achievements, statistics
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Notifications** - Instant injury alerts to coaches
- ‚úÖ **Data Security** - Row Level Security protecting all user data

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Wait for the project to be ready (2-3 minutes)
3. Note your project URL and anon key from Settings > API

### Step 2: Configure Environment

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

### Step 3: Set Up Database

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `database/schema.sql`
5. Click **Run** to execute

### Step 4: Set Up Storage

1. Go to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Create these buckets:
   - `videos` (for video uploads)
   - `avatars` (for profile pictures)
3. Set both buckets to **Public** for now (we'll secure them later)

### Step 5: Test the Setup

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit your app and try:
- Creating a new account
- Signing in/out
- Uploading a video
- Creating injury reports
- Viewing achievements

## üîê Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

Every table has RLS policies ensuring:
- Athletes only see their own data
- Coaches only see their athletes' data
- Injury reports automatically notify coaches
- Mental health data can be private to athletes

### Real-time Features

- **Injury Notifications**: Coaches get instant alerts when athletes report injuries
- **Workout Completions**: Real-time updates when athletes finish workouts
- **Data Syncing**: All changes sync immediately across devices

## üéÆ Sample Data

The schema includes sample data for:
- Demo coach accounts with codes `COACH123` and `SMITH456`
- All 21 track & field events with proper units
- Achievement categories and rarity levels

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Coach Codes

Coach codes are automatically generated but can be customized:

```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET coach_code = 'CUSTOM123' 
WHERE id = 'coach_user_id';
```

### Notification Settings

Configure notification triggers in the database:

```sql
-- Disable injury notifications for a specific coach
UPDATE coach_athlete_relationships 
SET status = 'no_injury_alerts' 
WHERE coach_id = 'coach_id';
```

### Storage Policies

Secure your storage buckets with RLS:

```sql
-- Only allow users to upload their own videos
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own videos" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot connect to database"**
- Check your `.env` file has correct Supabase URL and key
- Ensure your Supabase project is active

**"RLS policy violation"**
- Make sure you're signed in when testing
- Check that policies allow your user role to access the data

**"Video upload fails"**
- Verify storage buckets are created
- Check bucket permissions are set to public
- Ensure file size is under Supabase limits

### Getting Help

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Review Supabase logs in your project dashboard
3. Verify your database schema matches `database/schema.sql`

## üéØ Next Steps

After your database is set up:

1. **Test Core Features**: Try all major workflows (signup, training, recovery)
2. **Customize Settings**: Adjust notification preferences and privacy settings
3. **Add Real Data**: Start using the platform with real athletes and coaches
4. **Monitor Performance**: Use Supabase analytics to track usage
